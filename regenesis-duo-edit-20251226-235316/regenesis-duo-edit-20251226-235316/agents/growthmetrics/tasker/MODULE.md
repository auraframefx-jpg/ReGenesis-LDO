# ✅ Tasker Module - The To-Do List That Thinks

**Task management powered by AI that actually understands context.**

## 🚀 The Innovation

Tasker isn't just another to-do app. It's task management that **understands you**—your patterns, your priorities, your context. It knows when you're productive, what drains you, and how to optimize your flow.

## ✨ Intelligent Features

- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Tasks appear when you're ready
- **Priority Intelligence**: Knows what actually matters
- **Energy Matching**: Hard tasks when you're fresh
- **Flow Protection**: Doesn't interrupt your focus
- **Smart Reminders**: Right time, right place, right context

## 💡 The Difference

Traditional taskers: "Do this task."
AuraKai Tasker: "Based on your energy level, current location, and morning productivity pattern, now is the perfect time for this."
