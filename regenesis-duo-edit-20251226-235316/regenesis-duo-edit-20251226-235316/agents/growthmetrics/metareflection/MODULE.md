# 🎯 MetaReflection Module - Self-Aware AI

**AI that thinks about its thinking. Yes, really.**

## 🚀 The Future

MetaReflection gives AURA and KAI the ability to reflect on their own performance, learn from mistakes, and continuously improve. This is **AI that knows when it's doing well and when it needs to adapt**.

## ✨ Breakthrough Features

- **Performance Self-Assessment**: "How did I do?"
- **Strategy Adjustment**: Adapts approach based on outcomes
- **Bias Detection**: Recognizes and corrects its own biases
- **Learning Optimization**: Focuses on weak areas
- **Confidence Calibration**: Knows what it knows (and doesn't)

## 💡 The Impact

An AI that can evaluate itself is an AI that can improve itself. Forever.
